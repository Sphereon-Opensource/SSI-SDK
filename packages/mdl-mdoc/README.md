**Warning: This package still is in very early development. Breaking changes without notice will happen at this point!**

This SDK module provides mDL-mdoc support for the SDK. The heavy lifting is performed by our Kotlin Multiplatform
low-level library however. You can find that library in a
separate [Github repository](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/mDL-mdoc-multiplatform).
