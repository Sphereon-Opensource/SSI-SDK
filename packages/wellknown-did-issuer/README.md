  <br>Well-Known DID Verifier (Typescript) 
  <br>
</h1>

---

**Warning: This package still is in very early development. Breaking changes without notice will happen at this point!**

---

A `Sphereon SSI-SDK` plugin to verify relationships between the controller of an origin and a DID conforming to the DIF [spec for well-known DID Configurations](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/) It is written in Typescript and can be compiled to any target JavaScript version.

## Available functions

- registerSignatureValidation
- removeSignatureValidation
- verifyDomainLinkage
- verifyDidConfigurationResource

## Usage

### Adding the plugin to an agent:

```typescript
import { IWellKnownDidIssuer, WellKnownDidIssuer } from '@sphereon/ssi-sdk-wellknown-did-verifier'

const agent = createAgent<IWellKnownDidIssuer>({
  plugins: [
    new WellKnownDidIssuer({
      signatureVerifications: { verified: () => Promise.resolve({ verified: true }) },
      onlyVerifyServiceDids: true,
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Register signature verification callback:

Registers a callback function to be called within the verification process, to verify the signature of the credentials within the DID configuration resource.

```typescript
agent
  .registerSignatureVerification({
    callbackName: 'example_key',
    signatureVerification: () => Promise.resolve({ verified: true }),
  })
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(() => console.log('failed'))
```

### Remove signature verification callback:

Removes a registered callback function.

```typescript
agent
  .removeSignatureVerification({ callbackName: 'example_key' })
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(() => console.log('failed'))
```

### Verify domain linkage:

Verifies the relationship between the controller of an origin and a given DID.
Option available to only verify the service DID.

```typescript
agent
  .verifyDomainLinkage({
    did: 'did:key:z6MkoTHsgNNrby8JzCNQ1iRLyW5QQ6R8Xuu6AA8igGrMVPUM',
    signatureVerification: 'verified',
    onlyVerifyServiceDids: false,
  })
  .then((result: IDomainLinkageValidation) => console.log(result.status))
```

### Verify DID configuration resource:

Verifies a DID configuration resource and domain linkage credentials it holds.

You can either pass in a DID configuration resource or fetch it remotely by setting a secure well-known location (origin).
Option available to only verify a given DID.

```typescript
agent
  .verifyDidConfigurationResource({
    signatureVerification: () => Promise.resolve({ verified: true }),
    origin: 'https://example.com',
    did: 'did:key:z6MkoTHsgNNrby8JzCNQ1iRLyW5QQ6R8Xuu6AA8igGrMVPUM#foo',
  })
  .then((result: IResourceValidation) => console.log(result.status))
```
